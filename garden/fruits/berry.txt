STRAWBERRY
Scientific name: Fragaria x ananassa

Taste: sweet, juicy, slightly acidic

Health benefits: Bring on the antioxidant, polyphenol and anti-inflammatory perks. 
Due to their abundant flavonoids (which are natural compounds found in plants that protect the body
 against everyday toxins), eating strawberries on the regular may help curb cognitive decline. 
You can eat more than just the berry, too: Strawberry tops (aka the leaves) have been proven to aid 
gastrointestinal discomfort and joint pain. Try infusing water or vinegar with strawberry leaves, 
tossing them in a smoothie or steeping them in boiled water to make tea.

BLUEBERRY
Scientific name: Cyanococcus

Taste: sweet, floral, sometimes sour

Health benefits: Blueberries are loaded with heart-healthy potassium, folate, fiber and vitamin 
C. Like strawberries, blueberries boast plenty of memory-boosting antioxidants and anti-inflammatory
 properties. Studies show that they might delay cognitive aging as well, thanks to their high flavonoid 
levels.
