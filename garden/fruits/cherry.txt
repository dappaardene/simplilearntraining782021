Also known as black cherries, Chelan cherries resemble Bing 
cherries in appearance but have a milder (though still sweet!) taste.
 A hardy variety, these cherries ripen early in the growing season and 
are resistant to cracks and splits.

Grown in Michigan, Montmorency cherries are the most popular sour cherries in the U.S. 
You can typically find them frozen or canned, rather than fresh. Classic sour cherry pies 
are typically made with this variety. They're also used to make tart cherry juice. 
Try them in Ree's individual cherry almond crisps, which are made in ramekins.

Maraschino Cherries

The chewy, bright red cherries that top Shirley Temples aren't actually a special cherry variety, but rather refer to 
sweet cherries that have been preserved in brine, sweetened, and dyed. (High-end brands like Luxardo skip the dye, 
so they have a darker color.) Maraschino cherries are the perfect finishing touch for ice cream sundaes and baked goods 
like tres leches cake.



Amarena Cherries
