Also known as black cherries, Chelan cherries resemble Bing 
cherries in appearance but have a milder (though still sweet!) taste.
 A hardy variety, these cherries ripen early in the growing season and 
are resistant to cracks and splits.

Grown in Michigan, Montmorency cherries are the most popular sour cherries in the U.S. 
You can typically find them frozen or canned, rather than fresh. Classic sour cherry pies 
are typically made with this variety. They're also used to make tart cherry juice. 
Try them in Ree's individual cherry almond crisps, which are made in ramekins.
