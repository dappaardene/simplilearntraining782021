The word fig, first recorded in English in the 13th century, derives from (Old) French figue, 
itself from Occitan (Provençal) figa, from Romance *fica, from Classical Latin ficus (fig or fig-tree).


The fig fruit develops as a hollow, fleshy structure called the syconium that is lined internally with numerous unisexual 
flowers. The tiny flowers bloom inside this cup-like structure. Although commonly called a fruit, 
the syconium is botanically an infructescence, a type of multiple fruit. The small fig flowers and later small 
single-seeded (true) fruits line its interior surface. A small opening or ostiole, visible on the middle of the fruit, 
is a narrow passage that allows the specialized fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes to enter the inflorescence and pollinate the 
flowers, after which each fertilized ovule (one per flower, in its ovary) develops into a seed.
 At maturity, these 'seeds' (actually single-seeded fruits) line the inside of each fig. See Ficus: 
Fig fruit and reproduction system.
