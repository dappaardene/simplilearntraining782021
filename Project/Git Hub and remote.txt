+The word fig, first recorded in English in the 13th century, derives from (Old) French figue,
+itself from Occitan (Proven<E7>al) figa, from Romance *fica, from Classical Latin ficus (fig or fig-tree).
+
+
+The fig fruit develops as a hollow, fleshy structure called the syconium that is lined internally with numerous unisexual
+flowers. The tiny flowers bloom inside this cup-like structure. Although commonly called a fruit,
+the syconium is botanically an infructescence, a type of multiple fruit. The small fig flowers and later small
+single-seeded (true) fruits line its interior surface. A small opening or ostiole, visible on the middle of the fruit,
+is a narrow passage that allows the specialized fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes to enter the inflorescence and pollinate the
+flowers, after which each fertilized ovule (one per flower, in its ovary) develops into a seed.
+ At maturity, these 'seeds' (actually single-seeded fruits) line the inside of each fig. See Ficus:
+Fig fruit and reproduction system.
